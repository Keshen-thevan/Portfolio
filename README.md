# My portfolio 

This is a responsive portfolio website to showcase my skills and projects.

it uses a slider to slide through the projects and also changes between light and dark mode and saves the users preferance to local storage.

Things I learned: 
- one of the things that i engoyed inplementing was the nav menu on mobile. It acts similar to a hamburger menu but resembles the "apps" button on a mobile device. 

- another thing was working with slider.js  

Challenges: 
- the single most difficult thing to implement was the responsivness. However from this I did learn alot about how to making websites responsive to different screen sizes.
